# Find The Dog Memory Game
Project is deployed [Here](https://tobbe8808.github.io/javascript-p2/)

Github repository [Here](https://github.com/tobbe8808/javascript-p2/tree/main)

 This is a memory card game with a dog theme. The game starts with 24 cards all faced down so you don't know what picture is which.
 You will flip the cards two at a time and try to find the pictures that match if the cards don't match, they flip over again if they do match they stay up.
 If you pick the right two cards you won't lose any life, but if you pick the wrong cards that doesn't match a life will be taken from you.
 You have a timeframe of two minutes to finish the game and 8 lives that tick down every time you pick the wrong card.
 This game is for all ages cause it's a great way to practice your memory.

# Design

For the design I wanted to go for a Psychedelic design around the game and for the background of the cards, also in the text.<br>
The colors of the text are colorful but also easy to see for someone with visual impairment.<br>
Font-family used PT Sans for the page.<br>

# User Experience

## First time user

- For the first time user i want the game to be easy to navigate the Landing page and to get into the game.<br>
- The user should find the game easy to adapt and learn fast and wanting to stay and play.<br>
- The user should be able to play the game on multiple screens with diffrent resolutions so he's not forced to use it on his pc or phone.<br>

## Returning user

- The game is 2-3 times Return user friendly, but then the user expects more.<br>
- I think my game is a bit too simplistic for a returning user.<br>
- To get returning users the game needs for features so the user can feel that they progress.<br>
- High score and multiple difficulties is a good start to make the game return user friendly.<br>


## Owner goals

- My goals are to later on update the website with more features.<br>
- Adding a high score name board, Multiple difficulty levels.<br>
- These changes should make the website more friendly for returning users.<br>
- Try to keep the user interested for as long as possible with updates.<br>
